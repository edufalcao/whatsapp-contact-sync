A web app for syncing profile pictures from WhatsApp to Google Contacts.\
Matches contacts by phone number using [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) and [Google People API](https://developers.google.com/people).

## How To Use

1. Press "Get Started"
2. Scan the QR code with WhatsApp to authorize it
3. Connect your Google account
4. Choose your sync options
5. That's it!

The whole process takes about 2 minutes. Syncing runs at ~1 photo per second (due to Google API rate limits).

## How to Run Locally

In order for the backend to function, it requires an OAuth client id and secret + an API key.\
Since (for obvious reasons) this is a private app, you will need to create one for your own.\
You can see instructions on how to do that [here](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials).\
Once you do that, create the file `server/.env`, and set the following environment variables:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

The frontend fetches `CLIENT_ID` and `API_KEY` from the backend via `GET /api/config`, so no frontend changes are needed.

Once that's done, you can go ahead and run the app:

```bash
# Run backend
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

# Run web app
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build Docker Images

There are 3 different `Dockerfile`s for this app:

- [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) - This is an image containing both the backend and the web app
- [`Dockerfile`](web/Dockerfile) - An image containing only the web app
- [`Dockerfile`](server/Dockerfile) - An image containing only the backend

In order to build and run the complete app, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t picsync .
docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 picsync
```

In order to build the seperate images for the backend and frontend, execute the following commands from the projects main directory:

```bash
docker build -t picsync-backend -f server/Dockerfile .
docker build -t picsync-web -f web/Dockerfile .
```
